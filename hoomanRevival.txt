## workflows

## `index.html`: The main HTML file to display the game.
   *   `style.css`: For basic styling (optional for now).
   *   `script.js`: The main JavaScript file containing the game logic.
   *   `assets/`: A folder to store your game assets.
       *   `background.img.png`: Your hand-drawn background image.
       *   `character/`: A subfolder for character assets.
           *   `player.js`: (We'll use an image instead of a .js file for the character)
           * `player.png`: Your hand-drawn character image.
       *   `horizontal.plane.png`: Your hand-drawn horizontal plane image.

## Concept

# Text Adventure: The core gameplay will be driven by text descriptions and player choices.
# 2D Horizon: A single background image will represent the game world, with the player moving left or right along a horizontal plane.
# Hand-Drawn Assets: The character, background, and horizontal plane will all be hand-drawn images.
# Start Menu: A simple menu to start or exit the game.
# Console-Based Loading: The game will load assets and display information in the browser's console (for now).
# JavaScript: The entire game will be built using JavaScript.

### CI/CD

# Improve movement (Walk animation).
# Mechanics: > Trade dialog box
